 Development Action Items for Discussion with Engineering Team:

To implement the Cloud Posture Dashboard designed in the wireframes, the following action items should be considered for discussion with the engineering team:


 1. Backend / Data Integration
- Integrate with cloud provider APIs  to fetch cloud misconfiguration data.  
-  Normalize and store data  in a backend database to support multi-cloud views.  
- Implement a  risk scoring algorithm  to prioritize high-severity issues based on impact, exposure, and compliance.  



 2. Frontend / UI Development
- Develop dashboard  UI components :  
  - Security Overview table with filters and severity-based prioritization  
  - Issue Details view showing affected resources and risk explanations  
  - Remediation Guide with step-by-step instructions  
- Implement  interactive elements  like expandable issue details, hover tooltips, and clickable remediation steps.  
- Ensure  responsive design  for desktop and tablet usage.  


 3. Security & Access Control
- Add  authentication and authorization  for multi-account access.  
- Manage  API keys and secrets securely  for each cloud account.  



4. Alerting & Collaboration (Optional / Future Enhancements)
- Integrate  notifications  via Slack or email for critical misconfigurations.  
- Enable  assignment of issues  to specific engineers for workflow management.  

 5. Testing & QA
- Conduct  unit testing for backend logic and API integrations.  
- Conduct  UI testing  for filters, dashboards, and remediation flows.  
- Perform  performance testing  to ensure smooth handling of multiple accounts and large datasets.
