Wireframe Overview
I designed a 3-screen MVP flow in Figma to help security engineers quickly identify, understand, and remediate critical cloud misconfigurations.
Screen 1: Security Overview
 Provides a high-level view of security posture with severity-based prioritization and filters to reduce noise.


Screen 2: Issue Details
 Explains what the issue is, why it is risky, and which resources are affected to help engineers assess impact before taking action.


Screen 3: Remediation Guide
 Offers step-by-step remediation guidance to reduce time-to-fix and help engineers resolve issues confidently.


Annotations in the wireframes explain the reasoning behind each major element and how it supports the user’s workflow.
